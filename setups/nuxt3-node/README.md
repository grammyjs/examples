You can deploy your bots to Vercel as a serverless function that runs on
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

Webhook will be set automatically during the
[build](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/builds) when `scripts/build.ts` is
run.

Manage webhook: https://telegram.tools/webhook-manager#/<tg_bot_token>.

> Remember to add `Environment Variables` when deploying in vercel.
